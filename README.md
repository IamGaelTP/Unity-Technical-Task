# BLUE GRAVITY STUDIOS TECHNICAL TEST

It took me a little longer than the 48 hours since the pure clothe store was getting too easy for me, so I wanted to take this task to the next level.

### What I did:
I did some research on the Little Sim World game and tried to make a super small version of such a game.
I didn't just make a clothing store, I added a character customization system and an inventory, and at the same time I made a Stardew Valley style item store, along with a building system with Unity's Tiles.
I also added a dialog system for the interaction with NPCs, which in this case is the item seller, that also have a reward if you talk with them.

On the more technical side, I also created a game manager to control the whole game and a loading screen system. 
I also developed a simple cinematic for the start of the game although it is more a transition between cameras taking advantage of using Cinemachine.

I still spent a lot of time designing the interface of the game as well as the level design.
I created two scenes. One where it is the town and we have our house which we can enter, and another scene that is already inside the house where we can build things to better design the interior of this.

### Opinion
I have felt comfortable with the selection process. 
The first interview went well, then all the communication has been excellent with Marina. I really want to congratulate her; she is very attentive.

For this technical test, I wanted to challenge myself and show them more of what I can do because at a certain point I saw the task as something simple, so I wanted to make it more complex, based on the most important thing that was to make a store with buying and selling objects to use later.
Also, I saw that you use Insightful to track your work and I decided to learn it and use it for this project.
In total I worked 3 days of what would be a full-time position of 8 hours to complete this work which in my opinion, I did something complex in that time.
I am very interested in the Little Sim World game and if that is the project I would be working on, I have no problem although in general, whatever it is, I am fine.
